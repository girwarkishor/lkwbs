  			<p>A hearing care professional like C.C. Saha Ltd. can help you decide which hearing aid will suit you the most based on the nature and extent of hearing loss, your preferences, lifestyle, the size and shape of your outer ear and inner ear canal, etc. The main types of hearing aids are explained below:</p>

    	  	<div class="col-md-10 caption">
    	  		<p>BTE instruments are used for all types of hearing loss, from mild to profound, and are perhaps the most common forms of digital hearing aids where the instrument is fitted behind the ear and is connected to a plastic ear mold or a thin sound tube that comes down in front of the ear and directs amplified sound into the ear canal. As the electrical components are located outside the ear, the chance of moisture and earwax damaging the components is reduced, which can increase the durability of the instrument. BTE hearing aids are commonly worn by children or very aged people who often need a durable type of hearing aid.</p>

    				<p>The RIC model is a newer development in hearing aids and is suitable for mild to severe hearing loss. Often referred to as open fittings, the receiver of the RIC (loudspeaker) is placed within the canal and connected via a thin tubing instead of resting behind the ear, which makes the instrument particularly small, light, and inconspicuous. There are two primary benefits of RICs:</p>
    				<li>It makes the body of the device much smaller and lighter.</li>
    				<li>The sound quality at the eardrum is a clearer representation of the desired sound.</li>
    				<br><p>This makes the RIC one of the most popular hearing aids in the market today. </p>

				<p>These hearing instruments are custom-made where the casing needs to fit the individual contours of the person’s ear canal. The hearing aids are cosmetically appealing since they are not so easily visible when worn as these fit deeper in the canal than other types. A comfortable fit is achieved because the shell of the hearing aid is custom-made to the individual ear canal after taking a mold. Its deep placement in the ear canal gives a more natural experience of hearing. Unlike other hearing aid types, the sound can be collected more naturally by the shape of the ear, and can travel down into the ear canal as it would with unassisted hearing.</p>

	  	<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 caption choose">
				<p>CICs are fairly similar to ITCs except that it fits a bit further into the ear canal and extends deeper towards the eardrum. In fact, the tiny hearing aids can fit so deep in the ear canal that it is virtually undetectable. Like ITCs, these hearing aids are ideal for those who suffer from mild to moderate hearing loss and are typically suited for middle age users. Also, the hearing aids are generally more expensive than their BTE counterparts. The benefits of the CIC are not only cosmetic. Because the microphones are better hidden in the ear, there is less wind noise distraction, and the devices allow for easier wearing of headgears such as helmets
				<br><br>
				At C.C. Saha Ltd., we dispense all the above types of hearing aids based on your requirements. When you visit our Clinic, our audiologists conduct tests to ascertain your ability to hear across frequencies based on which they are able to recommend the most suitable hearing aid. They will also help you with the trial and fitting of digital hearing aids from our stock of reputed brands of companies across the globe. 
				<br><br>
				After the physical fitting, our technical staff will program your hearing aids and make adjustments based on your feedback and how these instruments sound. You will then be instructed how to operate and take care of your hearing aids. Wearing these instruments, you will not have to hear the amplified sounds of the frequencies that you are already hearing well. Only those frequencies where you are deficient will be boosted or amplified for your comfort and ultimate listening pleasure.
				<br><br>
				In today’s times, it is very important for you to be more receptive towards hearing aids. You will need to dispel the notion that wearing hearing aids can make you appear unwieldy, handicapped or old. Unattractive, bulky and old-fashioned styles, which were commonly associated with hearing aid devices have now made way for state-of-the-art, trendy, stylish and colorful hearing aids suited to all age groups. You can get all of this and more from C.C. Saha Ltd. - your one stop for all hearing needs.</p>
